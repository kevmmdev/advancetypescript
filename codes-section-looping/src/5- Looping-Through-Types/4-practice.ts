/**
 * Real-World Scenario:
 *
 * In an IoT backend project, you may receive asynchronous streams of data from multiple sensors,
 * such as temperature, humidity, and pressure. In order to analyze the data in sync,
 * you need to "zip" these streams together. The `synchronizeSensors` function allows you to combine
 * multiple arrays of sensor readings into a single array of tuples, where each tuple represents
 * the readings from all sensors at the same sampling time.
